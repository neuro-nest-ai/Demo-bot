Many volunteer organizations, particularly not-for-profit organizations such as charities and theaters, 
appoint treasurers who are responsible for conservation of the treasury, 
whether this be through pricing of a product, organizing sponsorship, 
or arranging fundraising events.[citation needed]

The treasurer would also be part of the group which would oversee how the money is spent, 
either directly dictating expenditure or authorizing it as required. 
It is their responsibility to ensure that the organization has enough money 
to carry out their stated aims and objectives, and that they do not overspend, or under spend. 
They also report to the board meetings and/or to the general membership the financial status of the organization to ensure 
checks and balances.[1] Accurate records and supporting documentation must be kept to a 
reasonable level of detail that provides a clear audit trail for all transactions.[2]
